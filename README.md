## Data Flow (Frontend,API call)
Page design:html and css
Page Functionality: Javascript
Regarding the css, Mobile-first design approch was implemented which we started by sketching or prototyping the web app's design for the smallest screen first and gradually working up to larger screen sizes.

## Main Functionalities
- A button that when clicked once -> increses the count at the header of the page by one and adds th ecolor name to the selected colors.
- When the same button is clicked again -> decreases the count at the header of the page by one and removing the color name from the selected colors.
